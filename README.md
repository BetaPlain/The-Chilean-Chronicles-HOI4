# The-Chilean-Chronicles-HOI4
The Chilean Chronicles is an in-depth modification for Hearts of Iron IV that (unrealistically) simulates an alternate universe where Chile had a super empire, owning the West coast of North and South America. The mod features custom countries, events, focus trees, and even formable nations.
